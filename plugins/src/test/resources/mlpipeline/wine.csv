460,US,"Proving that exceptional wines can be (and were) made in this cool, light vintage, this estate-grown selection is both elegant and complex. Flavors of mixed wild berries, a streak of tea, a whiff of peach and compelling balance carry it through an extended finish.",Ridgecrest Vineyards,92,50.0,Oregon,Ribbon Ridge,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Chehalem 2011 Ridgecrest Vineyards Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),Pinot Noir,Chehalem
461,US,"A marvelous Pinot Blanc, this combines aromatic hints of almond with mixed citrus fruit and rind, zippy acidity and a great wash of minerality. It cleanses and tickles the palate, lingering sensuously through a finish of surprising depth.",Stoller Vineyards,92,29.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Chehalem 2012 Stoller Vineyards Pinot Blanc (Dundee Hills),Pinot Blanc,Chehalem
467,US,"Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade.",Evenstad Reserve,92,65.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Domaine Serene 2010 Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Pinot Noir,Domaine Serene
480,US,"This Stella Mae is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc. It remains a rather lean wine in the Sparkman portfolio, despite having alcohol at 14.6%.

495,US,"This El Dorado wine opens with aromas of sweet floral jasmine and is very pretty through and through. Its acidity sings perfectly through the middle of the wine, lifting the flavors of apple and dried apricot as well as the notes of lemon and lime on the finish. This should pair with a range of midweek dinners.",Battonage,87,18.0,California,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Lava Cap 2010 Battonage Chardonnay (El Dorado),Chardonnay,Lava Cap
497,US,"This wine has the variety's trademark notes of herb, green bell pepper, with a woodsy qulaity.

507,US,"Medium bodied, this sharply defined wine brings in plenty of notes of herb, root and earth around its light berry fruit. It captures the defining flavors of Wahluke Slope Syrah in a somewhat muted style, reflecting the abbreviated growing season.",Clifton Vineyard,87,28.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Camaraderie 2009 Clifton Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),Syrah,Camaraderie
509,US,"This would be a straightforward Bordeaux red blend if not for the 5% Petite Sirah within. Together, it's 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec as well, sourced from Howell Mountain and valley floor sites. Dusty and herbal, the wine is thick and sizably tannic, with dense black fruit, leather and coffee.",Quantum,91,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Beringer 2014 Quantum Red (Napa Valley),Red Blend,Beringer
510,US,"Flint and smoke aromas show strongly on this bottling, alongside hints of lemon balm and a rustic apple cider vinegar savory kick. Tangy smoked tangerine flavors show on the energized sip, where a unique sandalwood smoky quality plays with more cider-like tang.",Coastview Vineyard,91,48.0,California,Monterey County,Central Coast,Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,Big Basin 2014 Coastview Vineyard Chardonnay (Monterey County),Chardonnay,Big Basin
513,US,"Big tannins support the layers of extracted, concentrated fruit that leans red into cherry, cassis and currant.

515,US,"Delicate in cranberry and strawberry, this wine is highlighted in uplifted acidity and plenty of length and breadth within its medium-bodied structure.

520,US,"Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors.

521,US,"This is a delicate yet flavorful take on this grape, from a biodynamic, cool-climate vineyard. Light red plum and hibiscus aromas meet with sweet herbs and cinnamon spice on the nose. The lithe palate offers candied strawberry with thyme, anise and touches of garden herbs, with that red fruit flavor carrying deep into the finish.

522,US,"The Sims is amped up in 2014, dark and thick and showing a roasted character. Mocha, black tea and Kahlua flavors push the palate into a gritty charred mode.

523,US,"There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish. Give it another year or two of bottle age and drink after 2019.",Steve's Reserve,91,65.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Ruby 2015 Steve's Reserve Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),Pinot Noir,Ruby

531,US,"One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully.

533,US,"Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through.
