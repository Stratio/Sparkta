About [Stratio Sparta](http://www.stratio.com/sparta)
============

At Stratio, we have implemented several real-time analytics projects based on Apache Spark, Kafka, Flume, Cassandra, ElasticSearch or MongoDB.
These technologies were always a perfect fit, but soon we found ourselves writing the same pieces of integration code over and over again.
Stratio Sparta is the easiest way to make use of the Apache Spark Streaming technology and all its ecosystem.
Choose your input, operations and outputs, and start extracting insights out of your data in real-time.

Main Features
============

- Pure Spark
- No need of coding, only declarative aggregation workflows
- Data continuously streamed in & processed in near real-time
- Ready to use out-of-the-box
- Plug & play: flexible workflows (inputs, outputs, parsers, etcâ€¦)
- High performance and Fault Tolerance
- Scalable and High Availability
- Big Data OLAP on real-time to small data
- ETLs
- Triggers over streaming data
- Spark SQL language with streaming and batch data
- Kerberos and CAS compatible

Architecture
============

Send one workflow as a JSON to Sparta API and execute in one Spark Cluster your own real-time plugins
![Architecture](./images/architecture.jpg)

Sparta as a Job Manager
------------

Send more than one Streaming Job in the Spark Cluster and manage them with a simple UI

Run workflows over Mesos, Yarn or SparkStandAlone

Sparta as a SDK
------------

Modular components extensible with simple SDK
- You can extend several points of the platform to fulfill your needs, such as adding new inputs, outputs, operators, transformations.
- Add new functions to Kite SDK in order to extend the data cleaning, enrichment and normalization capabilities.

Components
========

On each workflow multiple components can be defined, but now all have the following architecture

Core components
------------

Several plugins are been implemented by Stratio Sparta team
![Main plugins](./images/plugins.jpg)

Trigger component
------------

With Sparta is possible to execute queries over the streaming data, execute ETL, aggregations and Simple Event 
Processing mixing streaming data with batch data on the trigger process.

Aggregation component
------------

The aggregation process in Sparta is very powerful because is possible to generate efficient OLAP processes with 
streaming data
![OLAP](./images/OLAPintegration.jpg)

Advanced feature are been implemented in order to optimize the stateful operations over Spark Streaming
